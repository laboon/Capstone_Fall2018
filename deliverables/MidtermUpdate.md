This is a group project - only one proposal paper is expected from each group.

## DETAILS

This update should include an assessment of the current status of the project, what has been changed since the initial proposal, and what is expected for the rest of the term.

Here are some example questions I would like to see answered.  This does not mean that you need answer all of them, or even any of them, but I would recommend that you think about all of them now and discuss them with your group.

1. What is the general status of the project?  Are you on track to complete it?
2. Are there any features/user stories that you have needed to add/remove since the Proposal?
3. Have you made any changes to your _process_ since the proposal?
4. What parts of the software development process are working _well_?  Which ones are working _poorly_?
5. What are major risks to the project?
6. What questions are still outstanding about the project?
7. Do you need to make any further "course adjustments"?
8. What kinds of trade-offs are you making?  How are you determining priority?
9. What are the major issues that you have been experiencing?
10. What has been _easier_ than you thought?
