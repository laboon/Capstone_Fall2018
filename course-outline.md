## Course Information

**Taught by:** Bill Laboon

**Room**: G8 Cathedral of Learning

**Time**: Fridays 1:00 - 1:50 (internship and research), 1:00 - 2:50 (project and project studio)

**Instructor's Office Hours:**
  * Room: 6305 Sennott Square
  * Wednesday 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM, Friday 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM

_NOTE: You may also meet with the customer with whom you are working or one of their representatives._

All students shall submit a paper on their internship or project, as well as give an approximately 5-10 minute presentation on what they have done.  For students doing group projects, only one paper should be submitted per group and one presentation will be given per group.

The 1:00-1:50 section will include presentations from students (internship students first, then project students at the end of the term).  The additional time for project students will consist of lectures on software engineering for the first few lectures, and then shall be used as time for meeting with groups / sprint retrospectives / planning / etc.

Project students will also need to submit some other assignments, detailed below.

## Internship Students

You have two main responsibilities this term:

1. Schedule a presentation on the work that you did during your internship.  Do this by filing an issue on this repository (click on Issues then "New Issue") with your TOP THREE choices of which date to give your presentation.  Possible presentation dates are located in the presentation_schedule.md file in this repository.  Note you must select a date where INTERNSHIP presentations occur, NOT "Project" presentations.  You must schedule a presentation date by noon on THIS WEDNESDAY (5 SEPTEMBER) .  REMEMBER TO ADD "INTERNSHIP" TO THE BEGINNING OF YOUR ISSUE TITLE!

2. Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience and hand it in by the last day of class (7 DECEMBER).  For details, see FinalPaper.md in the /deliverables subdirectory in this repository.

## Details on Project Development:

The goal of this course is to develop a project, from start to finish, using modern software engineering tools and techniques.  The final project should be _well-written, well-tested, and well-documented_.

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, work should be done using git and GitHub or GitLab.  Work should be done in a private repository, and I should be added as a collaborator (username is "laboon" on both sites).  Please sign up for a student developer pack (which includes free private repositories, along with other free software) here: https://education.github.com/pack

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, the project will be developed using the Agile/Scrum software design methodology.  We will discuss this more in class.  One of the key tenets is that there is always some "working" version of the software, even if it does not include all of the features.  This means that at any point, you should have a working version of the software to show customers (and professors)!

We will consider every other class meeting the end of each sprint.  During this time, we will spend some time doing a retrospective in your groups - meeting for twenty minutes or so, in-person, to determine what went well with the last sprint and what could go better.  You will also come up with a plan for the next sprint.  Professor Laboon will be available at the end of each lecture to discuss the path forward with each group.

Since student schedules are often hard to reconcile, I recommend you use a chat application such as Slack to stay in touch with each other, even when you cannot meet in person.

As this is a capstone course, you are expected to be self-motivated and independent.  This may mean learning a new language, framework, architecture, etc.  Professional software engineers are often expected to learn these things independently, and you should be prepared to do so as well.  If you are unfamiliar with where to find training materials or information for a particular subject, you may discuss it with the instructor, but the onus is entirely on you to learn anything additional you need to know to complete the project.
